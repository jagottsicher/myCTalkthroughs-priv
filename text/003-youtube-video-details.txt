[SOLVED] What the heck is up with those _t data types in C? Is there a conspiracy behind it?

Description 5000
If you start writing code with the C programming language they may catch your attention when you have a look at some libraries: Identifiers with a trailing _t like time_t, size_t, and other kinds of _t data types, usually specific to some function or library. The C gurus have a method to their madness when it comes to naming those kind of things. _t is not an exception , it stands for something. And that's very consistent on purpose.
