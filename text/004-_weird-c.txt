If you've just taken your first tentative steps in the strange realm of the C programming language and have already acquired something that has some in common with self-confidence, then, well, be prepared that there's already some strangeness lurking around the next corner. But if you familiarize yourself with such encounters, they may quickly become a new tool for everyday life. And some of that weirdness we talk about today. Welcome to myCTalkthroughs.

Somehow talking about it now feels like trading your everyday clothes for a straitjacket. Recently, I was tinkering with a small tutorial C program that was supposed to explain the quicksort algorithm when I encountered one of these oddities -- strange, odd, weird, kind of bizarre at a first glance. This here is that simple program demonstrating quicksort:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

#define SIZE 100000

int compare(const void *a, const void *b);

int main()
{
    int qarray[SIZE];
    int x;

    /* init the randomizer */
    srand((unsigned)time(NULL));

    /* fill array with random numbers */
    for(x=0;x<SIZE;x++)
    {
        qarray[x] = (rand() % 1000000)+1;
    }
    printf("Array with %d elements created.\n",SIZE);

    /* quicksort */
    printf("Sorting ... ");
    qsort(qarray,SIZE,sizeof(int),compare);
    puts("Done!");

//    for(x = 0; x < SIZE; x++)
//    {
//        printf("Sorted #%d\n", qarray[x]);
//    }

    return(0);
}

int compare(const void *a, const void *b)
{
    return( *(int *)a - *(int *)b);
}

[EXPLANATION]

First it fills an array with 100k of random integers, and eventually sorts them. If we run it, as you see, it is unbelieveable fast. That's not surprising. Surprising is the qsort() function’s fourth argument. It is the name of the function that compares the values. Here's the funtion itself, just compare two values, after two pointers to pointers to pointer of int have been handled over. That's not what causes confusion here. Surpring here is how and what exactly is handled over here as an argument. look at this line [NUMBER] here_

qsort(qarray,SIZE,sizeof(int),compare);

The identifier "compare" is the name of the compare() function, which compares two values. But note: It is the name of a function and NOT a function call and therefore a return value from that function what is handled over as an argument to a qsort. Let that sink in! and from one moment to the next you suddenly find yourself stumbling like Alice in Wonderland deep into the rabbit hole even without any white rabbit hurrying you! 

So what kind of value do we pass over and how does that thing work here? 

A quote from the Joker impersonated by the unforgettable Heath Ledger is willing to provide a path to a solution: "Madness, as you know, is like gravity. All it takes is a little push."

Let's take that as a prompt to follow up: Like a variable in the C language, a function has an address — a location in memory where the function resides. This shouldn’t be surprising to you. After all, the function has to live somewhere. And, as I know, that location doesn’t change as the program runs.

A function’s address is an attribute used as an argument in several C language functions. You may have seen this requirement in some C Library functions already but didn't realise it. And so it does here in our call of quicksort:

[qsort(qarray,SIZE,sizeof(int),compare);]

Look at the qsort() statement. When a function is used as an argument, the parentheses are absent. This is NOT a function call and NOT returning anything. With the parentheses though, the function IS called and it does whatever and may return a value.

What you need to know here now is: Without parentheses, the function’s address is returned.

Here’s sample code:

#include <stdio.h>

int function(void)
{
    return(23);
}

int main()
{
    printf("The value of function() is %d\n",
            function());
    printf("The address of function() is %p\n",
            function);

    return(0);
}

In the first printf() statement, the value generated by function() is returned.
In the second printf() statement, the address of function() is returned.

Here’s how the output looks on my computer:

[The value of function() is 23
The address of function() is 0x10e95ce90]

It may now appear some "kind of normal" and leave you shrugging your shoulders and skip to a video of a woman on a futuristic motorcycle doing a wheely with a yodeling giraffe as a co-rider. When I learned about this thing here I felt for some time like Jhonny Depp in "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" recovering from a trip before preparing for the next level of reaching [in quotation marks] "higher consciousness".

Obviously, the address shown on my terminal here will be different from the one you see and the output may be different format as well. The point is though that without the parentheses, the compiler reads a function name as a memory location, a pointer. Function identifiers are a kind of variables and under the hood these variables are pointers. Hence function names are pointers to addresses in your memory and can be used as those.

As a pointer, a function also sports a variable type, which makes sense. If you want to get really weird, you can save a function’s address in a pointer variable and even use that variable to call the function. But that is too much madness for just one lecture -- remember we're just returning from Las Vegas. So, that's a different story and shall be told another time.
