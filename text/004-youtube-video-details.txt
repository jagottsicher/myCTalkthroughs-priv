The weird world of C programming. Welcome to mental insanity!

Description 5000
You've just taken your first tentative steps in the strange realm of the C programming language and have already acquired something that has a lot in common with self-confidence, then there's already some strangeness lurking around the next corner. But if you familiarize yourself with such encounters, they quickly can become a new tool for everyday life. And some of that weirdness we talk about today. Welcome to myCTalkthroughs.

Recently I was tinkering with a small tutorial program that was supposed to explain the quicksort algorithm when I encountered one of these oddities -- strange, odd, weird, kind of bizarre at a first glance.
